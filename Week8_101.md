# Password Validator

Passwords are nifty things, they protect your private inforation and give a user access to information or programs that aren't availible to all. But how do we know if a password is a "good" password or a "bad" password. We've likely see online that some websites require a certain number or characters, some upper and some lower, some special characters and some numbers, so how does all of this add up?

Well lets anser that ourselves by creating a program that will:

1. Ask a user for a password to validate or ask if they would like to see the strength or random passwords
2. IF checking a users password:
   1. check for the following conditions to be true:
      * Must contain **BOTH** upper and lower case letters
      * Must be at least 8 characters long
      * Must contain at least one number
      * Must contain a special character
   2. IF the password is valid continue to step 4, ELSE print("OUTPUT> Not a valid password")
3. ELSE checking a random valid string
   1. generate a random valid string of length 12 (8 letters, 2 numbers, and 2 special characters)
      * A valid string can be generated by adding a string of random letters with a string of random numbers and a string of random special characters.    
4. Check the strength of the password and display that to the user
   1. Check password strength by:
      * Keep track of a score that will get added to and subtracted from
      * number or letters : score += (n*4)
      * number of numbers : Score += (n*4)
      * Number of Special characters : score += (n*6)
      * Number of vowels : Score -= (n*3)
      * (number of upper case letters - number of lowercase letters) *2 : Score += this value (will be negative if few uppercase)
  
You will likely have to make good use of loops and conditionals and store several counters to accumilate each of these checks

While this password strength checker is simple compared to one used for your Twitter account, you can begin to see how you might be able to check for a great password. If you'd like to learn more you can check out the following link which shows additional checks that could be done: http://www.passwordmeter.com.

** Note: ** Do not impliment any more checking than specified above or it may not match up with the grading script.

Some of the abovementioned checks will require the use of loops. Feel free to do a bit of internet searching to learn if there is an easy way of doing any of the checks.

# Password Strength
The password strength should follow the following guidelines:
* Score < 20: Very Weak
* 20 <= Score < 40: Weak
* 40 <= Score < 60: Good
* 60 <= Score < 80 : Strong
* 80 <= Score < 100 : Very Strong

**Note: The Score is capped at 0 and 100, it cannot go above or below that value.**

# Input Format
Your input should be structured as follows:
```
INPUT> Would you like to check your own password or a random one? ( 1 or 2 ):
(if 1 pressed)
INPUT> Enter a password to validate: (your pass goes here)
```

# Output Format
Your output should be structured as follows:
```
...
Validating the password (random or user defined password goes here)
OUTPUT> The password (your pass goes here) is a (if invalid say invalid, othersise output password strength) password
```

# Sample Output 1
```
INPUT> Would you like to check your own password or a random one? ( 1 or 2 ): 1
INPUT> Enter a password to validate: Banana
Validating the password banana
OUTPUT> The password banana is a invalid password
```

# Sample output 2
```
INPUT> Would you like to check your own password or a random one? ( 1 or 2 ): 1
INPUT> Enter a password to validate: Abe1e#eb
Validating the password Abe1e#eb
OUTPUT> The password Abe1e#eb is a Very Weak password
```

# Sample Output 3
```
INPUT> Would you like to check your own password or a random one? ( 1 or 2 ): 2
Validating the password erTljpqB97(~
OUTPUT> The password erTljpqB97(~ is a Good password
```
      
# Helpful Hints
A String of random upper and lower characters can be generated using `string.ascii_letters`

A string of random letters can be generated using `string.digits`

A string of random special characters can be generated using `string.punctuation`
